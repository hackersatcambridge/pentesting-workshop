# Getting Started

Make sure you have:

* VirtualBox installed
* Kali Linux ISO downloaded

# Types of Pens

##

## No, not that type of pen testing

> "an attempt to evaluate the security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying
> to exploit vulnerabilities"

## Why?

- Prevent data breaches
- Test security policies
- Ensure system security
- Compliance to regulations
- Prove to customers that you are the best

# Steps to a successful pentest

1) Establish goal
2) Reconnaissance
3) Discovery
4) Exploitation, brute forcing, social engineering
5) Taking control
6) Pivoting
7) Evidence collection, reporting, remediation

# Establish a goal

##

Target is a very large and popular Wordpress site

##

`https://penreviews.ml`

![I spent way too long making this](img/penreviews.png)

##

We want to gain access to the system and access secret data, that could allow
a black-hat attacker full control over the system

# Reconnaisance

- Who is the admin?
- Hosting provider?
- Gather data from Facebook
- Customer support?
- Associated organisations?

# Discovery

## Finding targets

- Port and service scanning
- Vulnerability scanning
- Connected systems

## Results

- Wordpress instance running plugin vulnerable to XSS
- SSH server on non-standard port 2222, with password authentication
- MySQL server

# The attack

##

1) Use Metasploit to exploit Wordpress XSS
2) Gain MySQL access credentials
3) Retrieve password hashes from database
4) Brute-force password hashes
5) Attempt connection to SSH server

## Let's do it

# What happens next?

## Bug bounty programmes

- Companies invite you to attack their code
- Pay rewards for responsible disclosure
- Most big companies run one
- HackerOne supports bug bounty programmes for smaller projects

## Employment

- Contract work for a company to pentest their systems
- Or, employed directly to maintain security
- Get directly involved in remediation

## Black-hat

- Some people will pay large sums of money to learn about exploits...
- The police will also be very interested in you if you do this
